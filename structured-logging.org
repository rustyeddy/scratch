*** Structured Loggers in Go


+ [[https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus][Logrus]] the original Go structured logger
+ [[https://github.com/rs/zerolog][Zerolog]] a very fast structured logger by Netflix

** Select Apex for Go

It looks good and very similar to the standard / logrus logger. I
started using it on the [[http://rustyeddy.com/redeye][RedEye]] project. I really like it so far.

I have been using CLI mode, you can dictate the loggers by creating
custom handlers also, which can come in handy depending on the log
aggregation tool we use.
