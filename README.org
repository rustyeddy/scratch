* Scratch Pad

This is my scratch pad filled with some randomness. I am just now
*re-learning* org mode. It is very powerful, yet with quite a learning
curve. 

** Outline Mode 
   

The main thing about outline mode is that you can use your Asterix
to mark your headings.

They can easily cycle through heading levelsReducing the amountOf
texture looking at, kind of like in outline mode.

** Todo lists

This tool makes a great way to create todo lists. I just have to learn
how to use it.  I do know that creating a heading prefaced with the
text TODO will create a todo item!

*** TODO learn to use todo lists

Ok now I must learn to use todolists since I have made a verbal
commitment as such.

**** DONE learn to mark an item done.

To make an item complete or done, just move the marker to that line
and hit the key sequence: 'C-c C-t'. It will turn green and we are
ready to go.

** Agendas

It also creates agendas, by storing TODO's, and events it can also
create agendas.  Just use the key combo:

> \C-ca

Will result in a popup window with options to select an agenda.
